Robert Nurmi. 09/30/21,"Offshore PCB materials (even if sold by US companies) in sensitive A&amp;D programs (or any sensitive programs) is our primary concern. <br/> <br/>The DOD is rightly concerned on semi-conductor security of supply. Ensuring DOD semi-conductors are produced in the US is significant. However, once the semi-conductors are sourced in the US, they also need to be &ldquo;packaged&rdquo;. The &ldquo;package&rdquo; typically consists of  the semi-conductor mounted onto a miniature printed circuit board or substrate, which will be the component that will be assembled onto the main printed circuit board. These supply chains for packaging, printed circuit boards, and assembly also need to be sourced in the US. It does not make sense to resolve the sourcing of semi- conductors in the US, but then have to ship them to Asia for packaging, printed circuit boards, and assembly.<span style='padding-left: 30px'></span><br/> <br/>The raw materials (glass copper ,resin) within PCB materials, are also vulnerable for programs if not from &ldquo;friendly&rdquo; allies. Prepreg materials produced in Taiwan, supplied to US for lamination should be considered vulnerable.  Many A&amp;D designs call out generic IPC specs which allows the use of foreign material supply.<br/> <br/>I would have the DOD instruct their suppliers, Raytheon, Northrop, L3 Harris, Boeing, GD, etc, to do a supply chain review of their electronics sourcing, PCBs, materials, raw materials, to evaluate the risk. Every effort should be made to source from US, or at least friendly allies. <br/> <br/>We believe the A&amp;D electronics would be more secure by specifying on shore printed circuit materials and Printed Circuit Board Fabrication. AGC Multi Materials (Nelco and Taconic printed circuit materials), are produced in CA and AZ, USA. <br/> <br/>Thank you for your consideration.<br/><br/>Best regards,<br/><br/>Robert Nurmi<br/>Director of Technical Marketing<br/>AGC Multi Material America, Inc<br/>413-212-4464<br/> <br/> <br/> <br/>",[],https://api.regulations.gov/v4/comments/BIS-2021-0036-0004

Company Representative. 11/08/21,"On behalf of ResMed Corp., we appreciate the opportunity to provide input in response to the US Department of Commerce and Bureau of Industry and Security request for public comments on Risks in the Semiconductor Supply Chain. The &ldquo;Notice of Requests for Public Comments on Risks in the Semiconductor Supply Chain&rdquo; was published in the Federal Register on September 24, 2021<br/><br/>ResMed is a pioneer of digital innovative solutions that treat and keep people out of the hospital, empowering them to live healthier, higher-quality lives.  Our digital health technologies and cloud-connected medical devices transform care for people with sleep apnea, chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD), and other chronic diseases.  ResMed&rsquo;s comprehensive out-of-hospital software platforms support the professionals and caregivers who help people stay healthy in the home or care setting of their choice.  By enabling better care, we improve quality of life, reduce the impact of chronic disease, and lower costs for consumers and healthcare systems.<br/><br/>More than 15.5 million patients worldwide are remotely monitored at home with cloud-connectable devices and more than 130 million patient lives changed in the last 12 months.  Our aim is to deliver life-changing products and connected health solutions worldwide to people with sleep apnea or other respiratory conditions, and to spread awareness about these conditions and treatments.  We enable remote and self-monitoring via our therapy devices to improve patients&rsquo; experiences, health outcomes, as well as efficiency in patient management.  <br/><br/>As a leading digital health company, ResMed aims to present the Department a perspective that demonstrates just how vital our reliance on semiconductor chips is to the larger healthcare delivery system. As the medical community continues to rely on technological solutions to monitor patients during this time of Public Health Emergency from virtually anywhere, and at any time, practitioners have been forced to more effectively (while at a distance) manage space, time, logistics, and patients.   Robust mobile networks and advanced digital medical tools are making the promise of reducing hospitalizations the new reality.  Doctors can now more readily identify exacerbations, help patients improve medical adherence, and increase their efficiencies. Connected medical devices and solutions are becoming commonplace and an essential (integral) part of the delivery of care and therapy management, and help save and improve millions of lives every day. We look forward to working with the Department of Commerce, the interagency and key private sector partners to raise awareness about our unique and critical chip needs for these life saving technologies.<br/><br/>","[('P ResMed Inc. - BIS IC Comment Form', 'https://downloads.regulations.gov/BIS-2021-0036-0067/attachment_1.xlsx')]",https://api.regulations.gov/v4/comments/BIS-2021-0036-0067

Confidential treatment is warranted because Volvo customarily and actually treats the information as private, and because, to the extent an assurance of confidentiality is required, the Department of Commerce&rsquo;s past practice of protecting voluntarily-submitted sensitive business information provides such an assurance.","[('P Volvo BIS IC Comment Form', 'https://downloads.regulations.gov/BIS-2021-0036-0082/attachment_2.xlsx')]",https://api.regulations.gov/v4/comments/BIS-2021-0036-0082

Alan Pan. 10/04/21,"I advertise, market, and promote semiconductors and its applications to solving problems, such as automation and computing. I am a first generation Chinese American, and on many occasions since 2016 people in the United States have been attempting to forcibly separate me from the supply chain. However, my family background and responsibilities are stronger than that, which I continue to promote the use of semiconductors to solve modern world problems.<br/><br/>I have extensive knowledge and experience on the individual use of semiconductors, and I intentionally extend the use of semiconductors to promote its manufacturing and sale in China. I push boundaries, challenge human ability and thinking, and create demand for others to use semiconductors to assist or augment their thinking and solutions. By driving up demand for semiconductors to solve modern world problems, my home province in China increases their innovation and production of semiconductor technology and sells to US industries and companies, among others. Increasing multilateral and multinational complexities would also theoretically increase the demand and use of semiconductors, evident that I am one of many people attempting to promote the use of semiconductor technology. I especially use semiconductors for the purposes of computing, data storage, and the processing and transmission of information across people.<br/><br/>I was born and raised in the United States of America. The US or state government and Department of Defense have been pulling my strings since the late 1990s when I was a child. I have been mentored by &quot;ghosts&quot; and &quot;paranormal activity&quot; who have assisted me in providing intelligence and information on problems to solve. These, in turn, revealed more problems that needed to be solved. I have been able to cross-verify my solutions to these problems through movies, television, and other media. Today, being single, unmarried, childless, without a romantic partner continues to motivate my endeavors to challenge the boundaries of the United States and promote the use of semiconductor technology. It does not seem my circumstances will change anytime soon for those &quot;pulling my strings&quot; as I continue to promote its use through computing and other tools to solve modern day problems. However, people need to recognize that today&#39;s problems, after so many problems have been solved, is significantly and increasingly more complicated as each layer of problems have a solution, as more and more people are able to compete over alternative solutions to solve the same problems.

Brian Trevino. 10/17/21,"The semiconductor industry is critical in that the integrated circuitry produced by these manufacturing firms end up in nearly every aspect of our society (our home and work environments and personal devices we use daily).  Unfortunately, we do not see curriculum informing America&#39;s youth, particularly at the high school level, about the semiconductor industry and its significance and intrigue as a profession.  As the subject of student loan debt becomes increasingly controversial due to entanglements and complications with loan servicers, I highly encourage the Biden Administration to implement accredited semiconductor technology trade programs that will allow America&#39;s high school graduates to enter into trade programs and prepare them for prosperous careers in the semiconductor manufacturing industry.  Of course, this would also involve incentives for the world&#39;s leading semiconductor manufacturers (e.g., STMicroelectronics) to return manufacturing operations to the United States.  This is certainly an industry that the United States should be leading.",[],https://api.regulations.gov/v4/comments/BIS-2021-0036-0008

Alexis Abramson. 11/08/21,"Leadership in semiconductor &quot;chip&quot; manufacturing requires a well-trained workforce and continuous innovation. Modernization of educational curricula and research &amp; training facilities is needed to complement industry investments in advanced development and manufacturing. Therefore we propose the establishment of a nationwide network of universities and colleges (hereinafter referred to as the American Semiconductor Academy, or ASA) geographically distributed across the U.S., organized into Western, Central, and Eastern Regions, to<br/>   (1) increase and broaden access to education and technical careers in semiconductor manufacturing, filling the pipeline of talent for chip manufacturers in the U.S., and<br/>   (2) to facilitate the commercialization of innovations that originate in university research labs, to ensure that leading-edge chip products will always be manufactured first in the U.S.<br/>Specifically, to achieve these goals:<br/>   (1) An up-to-date and comprehensive curriculum in integrated circuits and systems, semiconductor devices and microfabrication technology will be developed jointly with the semiconductor industry and shared across the ASA network, to facilitate education of a broad diversity of undergraduate and graduate students, to prepare them to enter the U.S. semiconductor manufacturing workforce;<br/>   (2) Hands-on experience with semiconductor devices and integrated circuits, microfabrication, and wafer processing tools will occur at &quot;hub&quot; universities in each of the Regions, that are equipped and staffed to support this training. These facilities will be accessible to all students who have completed prerequisite ASA courses. <br/>The ASA should be appropriated funding to support curriculum development and dissemination, new faculty hiring, student scholarships and fellowships, industry internships, as well as equipment and facilities upgrades and all operational costs of hands-on workforce training at ASA universities and colleges. Ideally, funding would also support proof-of-concept wafer-scale prototyping in university facilities designed to be flexible to incorporate new materials, processes and devices into demonstration circuits and systems. We estimate that for each $100MM per year invested, up to 2000 additional trained graduates (AA, BS, MS &amp; PhD degrees) will be produced for the semiconductor industry annually.<br/>Only a broad, inclusive network of universities and colleges - the ASA - can meet the workforce development need for the U.S. to become a dominant producer of semiconductor chips once again. Dartmouth College is interested to actively contribute to and participate in this network as a hub facility to provide hands-on training in microfabrication and equipment maintenance and repair, and would build on its record of partnering with minority serving institutions (HBCUs and HSIs) to broaden participation.","[('BIS-2021-0036-0002_content - Dartmouth', 'https://downloads.regulations.gov/BIS-2021-0036-0092/attachment_1.xlsx')]",https://api.regulations.gov/v4/comments/BIS-2021-0036-0092
