We have empirically analyzed appointments to working group chair positions in four Standards Development Organizations (SDO): 3GPP, IETF, OneM2M, and IEEE&rsquo;s 802.11 Working Group. We have analyzed the number of working group chair positions held by Chinese individuals, as well as by individuals affiliated with Huawei.    <br/><br/>We would like to share the following findings:<br/><br/>-<span style='padding-left: 30px'></span>Chinese individuals are significantly less likely to be appointed to chair positions than similarly experienced individuals from certain Western countries.<br/><br/>-<span style='padding-left: 30px'></span>In recent years, Huawei was the affiliation with the largest number of attendees in each of the four SDOs that we studied. Huawei&rsquo;s share was larger among working group chairs than among attendees, but the extent of that over-representation was not larger than that of other large companies.<br/><br/>-<span style='padding-left: 30px'></span>There are indications that Huawei has actively pursued a leading position within these. Huawei has recruited a particularly large number of individuals with significant prior SDO experience; and Huawei employees are particularly assiduous meeting attendees. <br/><br/>-<span style='padding-left: 30px'></span>Individuals are primarily appointed to SDO leadership positions because of their individual characteristics; in particular SDO experience and technical expertise<br/><br/>-<span style='padding-left: 30px'></span>Affiliation with a large SDO stakeholder has a significant positive effect on individuals&rsquo; likelihood of being appointed to SDO chair positions in some SDOs. Being appointed to chair positions furthermore has a positive effect on the likelihood that an individual is recruited by one of these large commercial SDO stakeholders in some SDOs. We found both effects to be significant at IETF, but not at 3GPP. Huawei is not statistically significantly different from other large commercial SDO stakeholders in both regards.<br/><br/>Based on our findings and our extensive prior research on SDOs, we would like to offer the following comments: <br/><br/>-<span style='padding-left: 30px'></span>The participation of Chinese individuals and organizations in international ICT standards development is beneficial for the development of internationally coherent ICT standards. While we document a pattern of increased Chinese participation in SDOs, we did not find evidence that any of these SDOs is currently at risk of being dominated by Chinese interests.<br/><br/>-<span style='padding-left: 30px'></span>Most leadership positions in SDOs are held by employees of private companies that have commercial stakes in the SDO&rsquo;s decisions. Perceived or actual conflicts of interests of SDO leaders may weaken the legitimacy of SDOs. The trustworthiness of SDO governance is thus of paramount importance. <br/><br/>We would like to offer the following recommendations:<br/><br/>-<span style='padding-left: 30px'></span>Efforts to restrict the participation of Chinese individuals or organizations in ICT standards development and their representation in SDO leadership appear unwarranted. <br/><br/>-<span style='padding-left: 30px'></span>Concerns over undue influence by Chinese organizations, or any other actor; are best addressed within the framework of SDOs&rsquo; governance.<br/><br/>-<span style='padding-left: 30px'></span>SDO policies allowing individuals to actively participate in SDO activities on their own behalf do not eliminate the influence that the affiliations of individual SDO participants may exercise. The most significant check on undue influence by any individual organization is competition between different stakeholders and between different interest groups. <br/><br/>-<span style='padding-left: 30px'></span>OMB Circular A-119 defines &quot;Voluntary consensus standards bodies&quot; as organizations that are characterized by certain governance principles: (i) Openness. (ii) Balance of interest. (iii) Due process. (vi) An appeals process. (v) Consensus. These governance principles are conducive to objective technical decision-making, and promote meritocracy in the selection of SDO leadership. Policies or efforts that target one type of stakeholders (e.g. Chinese companies) are not in line with these principles; they are also likely to lead to international fragmentation of ICT standards, which may negatively affect US companies&rsquo; access to important foreign markets.<br/><br/>We are available to discuss the findings of our research, or provide additional information on our methodology for studying appointments to SDO leadership positions. We hope that our research may be useful to support NIST&rsquo;s own analysis in this important matter.<br/><br/>Sincerely,<br/>Dr. Justus Baron,<br/>Dr. Olia Kanevskaia<br/><br/>Dr. Justus Baron is a Senior Research Associate in Economics at the Center on Business, Law, and Economics (CLBE), Northwestern University School of Law. <br/>Dr. Olia Kanevskaia is an Assistant Professor of Law at University of Utrecht. <br/>","[('Baron Kanevskaia Global Competition for SDO Leadership Positions', 'https://downloads.regulations.gov/NIST-2021-0006-0031/attachment_1.pdf')]",https://api.regulations.gov/v4/comments/NIST-2021-0006-0031
